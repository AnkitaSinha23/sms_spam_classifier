About

Using a variety of ML techniques, we attempt to categorise SMS messages as SPAM or NOT SPAM. The steps to process and examine the dataset, convert messages to vectors, and use ML algorithms for the same are contained in the notebook (SMS spam classifier.ipynb).

Dataset

The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.
